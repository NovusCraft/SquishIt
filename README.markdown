								.Add("~/css/file1.css")
								.Add("~/css/file2.css")
								.Render("~/css/combined_#.css"))

*Explanation*
1. All CSS bundling is handled via `SquishIt.Framework.Bundle.Css()` API.
2. Call `.Add()` method to specify which files to bundle.

This will combine files in the order they were specified and minify them using Microsoft Minifier.
